This presentation was created for my developers.
We moved from Silverlight, C#/.NET, SqlServer to HTML/CSS/JavaScript, Java & DB2.

This is a history of the last decade & Microsoft's place in it. Where technology is, where it might go.

This presentation uses the very cool framework impress.js name in [courtesy of @skuzniak](http://twitter.com/skuzniak/status/143627215165333504).

The presentation only works in webkit based browsers... and that's my point. IE doesn't cut it, up through IE10.
